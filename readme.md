1. Enter (like type a key and press enter) any key to continue to the game.
2. Then you have two options: R to continue, and roll. Or E to exit.
3. If you get a number, or a card corresponding to it's card number. You win that round. For example, if card number 1 was a key card. It has to be equal to 1. The reason is that it is
